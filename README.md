# :cactus: d3-hiervis - Hierarchical visualization with D3

"Many datasets are intrinsically hierarchical. Consider geographic entities, such as census blocks, census tracts, counties and states; the command structure of businesses and governments; file systems and software packages. And even non-hierarchical data may be arranged empirically into a hierarchy, as with k-means clustering or phylogenetic trees." [d3-hierarchy README](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy)

This module is based on [d3 hierarchy](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy) and makes it easier to use and switch between several popular techniques for visualizing hierarchical data, including sunburst, sankey and partition.
